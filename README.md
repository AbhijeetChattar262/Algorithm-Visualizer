# Algorithm Visualizer

## Overview

The **Algorithm Visualizer** is a web application built with React.js that provides interactive visualizations of various algorithms, including searching, sorting, and data structures. This project is designed to help users better understand how algorithms work through visual representation. Additionally, it features an AI chatbot powered by the Gemini API, which offers assistance and answers questions related to the algorithms, making it easier for users to grasp complex concepts.

## Features

- **Algorithm Visualization**

  - Visualizes various algorithms, including:
    - Sorting Algorithms (e.g., Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort)
    - Searching Algorithms (e.g., Binary Search, Linear Search)
    - Data Structures (e.g., Stacks, Queues, Linked Lists)
  - Step-by-step animation of algorithms to demonstrate their functioning.
  - Interactive controls to pause, play, or step through the algorithm.

- **AI Chatbot Integration**
  - Integrates with the Gemini API to provide an AI-powered chatbot.
  - Offers explanations and answers questions related to the algorithms being visualized.
  - Helps users understand the underlying concepts and logic of each algorithm.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
